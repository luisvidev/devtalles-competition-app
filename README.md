## üíª Introduction

Welcome to the DevTalles Community Raffle App!

This powerful tool is your ticket to seamlessly organizing and executing raffles among community members at any time. Whether it's distributing prizes, fostering engagement, or simply spreading excitement, your app is ready to make it happen.

So, sit back, relax, and let the raffles begin!

This app is the deliverable for the [Code Quest 2024](https://twitter.com/DevTalles/status/1763607606289993817), a progamming challenge for the DevTalles community.

The application allows admin user to do the CRUD about raffles. Also, it allows that students can participate in different raffles if they belongs to the discord community.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:luisvidev/devtalles-competition-app.git
```

3. Go to [Discord developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) adn then, create a Discord application. Keep the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with you.
   _Note: if you need help at this point, read [this tutorial.](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-starte)_

4. Rename `.env.template` file for `.env` .
